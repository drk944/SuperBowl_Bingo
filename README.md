Simple Super Bowl Bingo generator
=================================

I wrote this the morning of the super bowl to create a fun bingo game so that the non-sports family members could still participate and have something fun to do. The game ended up being really fun and no one got a bingo until the 4th quarter, in which within 5 minutes of gametime 2 more people also got a bingo! 

The board is a 7x7 and there are three categories of events:
1. Commerical Brands
  a. Mtn Dew, Doritos, Jeep, etc
3. Celebrity appearance (either at game or in commercial)
  a. Taylor Swift, Matt Damon, Paul Rudd
5. Actual things that happen in the game
  a. Missed Field Goal, Interception, pass interference, etc

The board is setup such that to get 7 in a row in any direction (including main diagonals), a bingo will consist of 2 commericals brands, 2 celebrity appearances, and 3 football related events.
This specific format can be edited, as well as all the different bingo squares.

# TODO:
This was a great first run, for next year though there's some obvious issues and knowing myself, I won't fix until next Feburary.
1. The formatting stinks
2. The pipeline to generate boards is convoluted
3. I need to update each of the bingo items to be game specific
4. I need to make some of the football related items less specific
5. The font on the bingo cards had issues and wasn't a high resolution
